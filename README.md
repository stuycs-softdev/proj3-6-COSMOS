Project ARIES (Alternate Reality Integration Enhancement System)

...It sounds a lot cooler than it actualy is.

ARIES is a game that will take a map and overlay a fantasy world over it (that's the Alternate Reality part.) The game is intended for mobile devices and promotes players going to these places in real-life to interact with them in the fantasy world (there's your Integration.) It's should be more interesting than real life (Enhancement! That was weak, I know.) It's a system (there's your System.)
